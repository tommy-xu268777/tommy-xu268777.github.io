I am Haowen Xu, currently a second-year Ph.D. student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xiaoyan Sun](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/xsun7) and co-advised by [Prof. Jun Dai](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/jdai). Prior to joining WPI, I earned my B.S. degree from Nanjing University in 2024.

My research focuses on **Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence** and **Cyber-Physical System Security**. I am passionate about building AI systems that are not only intelligent but also reliable, secure, and deployable in safety-critical applications. My work explores the challenges at the intersection of machine learning robustness and the security of interconnected physical systems.
